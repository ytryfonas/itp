## Phase 3
  
### My process

  For phase3 I started by copying my code from phase2 into a new processing sketch and made the size larger. Then I created the drawObject function, following the assignment instructions and template. I added scale() and translate() and cut the code from the draw function and pasted it in the drawObject function. After that I added push() and pop() to save the drawing style, as mentioned in the assignment. Lastly I called the new function in the draw function three times, putting my drawing in three different positions, with three different scales.

### Troubleshooting

  There was a weird bug with processing were I could not run the program but after restarting my computer it was fixed somehow.

### Code Used

  - Similarly to phase2, all the code I used was from the assignment, it's the same thing just with a different drawing.
  - I referenced the processing documentation on the new objects to figure out how they functioned.
