## Phase 2

### My process

  For phase 2 I opened processing and started 'translating' what I had written on graph paper to my program. I started out by finding the ellipse centers widths and heights to add the face and the eyes. Then I made the rest of the drawing using lines. I decided to use a white background and a grey stroke (100). Lastly, I added a fill(0) only for the irises of the cat.

### Troubleshooting

  The mistake I was making was that I added fill(0) and then did not add noFill() after the iris ellipses and the whole face of the cat was printing black.

### Code used

  - I used the example code provided in the assignment as a starting point.
  - I used the processing reference for all the objects I used.
