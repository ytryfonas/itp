## Power HW

### Process:

   To create a program that prints out a graph of y = x^2 I made a for loop that goes from 8 to -9 incrementing by -1. It goes down to -9 to generate the whole range from 8 to -8. During the loop I use 'i' as the y variable and print out x^2 for each line.

### Troubleshooting

- I had a variable in my code that was not needed that I removed and replaced with a '*' in the print argument. Also, I removed some parenthesis because they were unnecessary due to the order of operations.

### Code used

- The code I used was from the controlflow README.md.
