## Mice Homework

- Because the assignment said we can only use one print function, I figured I should use the \n newline and manually count the spaces so my output would look like the disired output from the homework md file.

- I had to trouble shoot a bit to find out the correct number of spaces that were needed. I run my code on terminal to test and through trial and error I found the correct result. To display number 3 as a result of a calculation I simply made a variable and made it equal to 3. Then I broke the long str that was in my print argument in to two strings and replaced the 3 that was in it with the variable x.

### Code Used

- I used the 'print()' function, which is mentioned on chapter 1.3 of the book "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" by Allen Downey

- I also used '\n', which is mentioned on chapter 5.11 of the book "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" by Allen Downey
