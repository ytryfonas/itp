# Final Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Guitar Proficiency Training Tool

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project.

 A program that asks you one random question from each of the guitar Proficiency categories.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

  My program will have the user choose their Proficiency level. Then, depending on the level it will give out questions. I'm also planning on having the questions that were asked not be asked again unless all of the questions have been used or the user resets the program. Also, I plan to add a calendar feature for the user to track how much they have improved. I plan to write the program in VS code using Python, but I'm unsure how to do the ui in python, so I might use javascript if I don't figure that out.

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

  - user choosing their level
  - random questions depending on the level
  - non repeating questions
  - simple ui

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

  - user choosing their level
  - random questions depending on the level
  - non repeating questions
  - more advanced ui
  - calendar system
  - score tracking

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

  I need to either learn how to make a ui in Python or code in Javascript. I will also probably need to research HTML and CSS. After deciding what languages to use, I will break down my project into smaller pieces, making it more manageable.
